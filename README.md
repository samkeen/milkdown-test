# Tauri + Vue 3 + Milkdown

This is a Demo skeleton of using [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/) within a 
[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) app.  The Tauri app frontend is built with Vue 3.

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own awesome project.

There are also some additional Milkdown/Vue [examples](https://github.com/Milkdown/examples) 
from the folks at Milkdown that you can adapt to the Tauri shell.

## Installation
